<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Harris Zacharis ("us", "we", or "our") operates the "Singularity" mobile application (the "Service").</p>

<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

<p>We don’t collect any of your personal info, including your IP address. We don’t sell your personal info to advertisers or other third parties.  By using the Service, you agree to the use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>

<p>We don't store your data, period. We physically can't. So even if Taylor Swift asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show her.</p>

<h2>Links To Other Sites</h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
<p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
